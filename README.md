# CME Trade Summary
## CME Market by Price data
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) broadcast Globex market data via Market Depth 3.0 platform. CME Market by Price (MBP) records each market data message sent to the CME at every trading day with nanosecond timestamp. Each message is aligned with a packet. MBP data is taped with the FIX (Finical Information eXchange) protocol. MBP aggregates the market data message at up to ten price depths of a limit order book (LOB) if traders submit, revise or cancel their orders. Each trade is also recorded in the MBP with distinct message tags. MBP data incremental refresh information of each price level of LOB through three update actions, add, modification, and cancellation, with different tag values corresponded to them, respectively. MBP is recorded for each commodity with various contracts at every trading day and one incremental refresh may contains multiple updates for different contracts, depending on when corresponding orders are recorded by the MBP. MBP records market data messages through a weekly rather than daily horizon, with update sequence number assigned continuously in a week, namely from Sunday to Friday. MBP could only update information related to each price level literally, while deeply individual order activities are not recorded in the MBP. Hence, MBP only dissimilates summary information of the best 10 depths of LOB and it is uncapable of tracking order details or identifying iceberg orders explicitly though the latter could be implicitly estimated. MBP data parsing mainly consists of two perspectives, one is trade summary and the other is book management. The former is usually defined as time and sales data while the latter could be further reconstructed as a n-depth limit order book (LOB) or a best bid-offer (BBO).
